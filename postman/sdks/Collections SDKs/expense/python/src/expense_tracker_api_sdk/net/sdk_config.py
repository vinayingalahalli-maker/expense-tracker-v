    Whether a response should be validated against its declared schema.

    Lives next to the ``ValidationConfig`` declaration so the key's only reader sits with its
    definition. Turning validation off is the standard mitigation when a server drifts from its
    spec -- an extra enum member, a widened range -- because otherwise every response fails
    client-side and the SDK is unusable until the spec is corrected.

    An absent key falls back to the generated default rather than being read as False, so a
    partial ``validation`` dict does not silently disable validation.
